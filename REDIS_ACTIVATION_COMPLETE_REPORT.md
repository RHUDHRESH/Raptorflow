   - Fixed URL parsing for Upstash HTTPS endpoints
   - Implemented proper error handling and connection testing

2. **Production Manager Enhancement**
   - Added sync/async client detection
   - Implemented proper monitoring for both client types
   - Fixed background task compatibility

3. **Session Management Activation**
   - Full session persistence with 24-hour TTL
   - Metadata tracking for user sessions
   - Rate limiting with configurable windows

4. **Caching Strategy Implementation**
   - User profile caching (30 min TTL)
   - Campaign data caching (15 min TTL)
   - Analytics result caching (5 min TTL)

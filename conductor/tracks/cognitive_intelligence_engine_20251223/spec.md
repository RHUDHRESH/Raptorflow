# Specification: Cognitive Intelligence Engine (100-Phase SOTA Build)

## 1. Overview
The Cognitive Intelligence Engine is the industrial-grade "brain" of RaptorFlow. It transforms messy business context into surgical execution through a massive, multi-agentic system. Following the principles of **MLOps at Scale** and **SOTA Agentic Design**, it features a cyclic LangGraph "Cognitive Spine," multi-modal memory systems, and a comprehensive toolbelt for autonomous marketing operations.

## 2. Core Architectural Pillars (Learnings Integrated)

### 2.1 MLOps & Scalability (Osipov Principles)
- **Serverless Inference:** Scalable Cloud Run endpoints for agent nodes.
- **Data Pipelines:** Integrated validation and ingestion (Firecrawl/Jina) for high-fidelity research.
- **Distributed Context:** Handling massive brand contexts through intelligent sharding and vector retrieval.
- **Monitoring & CI/CD:** Automated testing for agent logic, telemetry for token usage, and latency tracking.

### 2.2 Agentic Intelligence (Taulli & Deshmukh Principles)
- **LangGraph Spine:** State-managed cyclic workflows allowing for iterative refinement.
- **Supervisor & Swarm Collaboration:** Hierarchical control with the ability to spawn task-specific swarms.
- **Multi-Modal Memory:** 
    - *Semantic:* Long-term knowledge (pgvector).
    - *Episodic:* History of interactions and "Moves."
    - *Procedural:* Learned skills and tool usage patterns.
- **Reflection & Self-Correction:** Dedicated "Audit" nodes that critique and improve outputs before user delivery.

## 3. Scope of the 100-Phase Build
- **Foundation:** Brand Kit & Positioning agents.
- **Cohorts:** ICP & Segmentation intelligence agents.
- **Moves:** Weekly execution & autonomous social distribution agents.
- **Campaigns:** 90-day strategic arc planning agents.
- **Muse:** Multi-modal asset generation (Text, Image, Layout) agents.
- **Matrix:** Telemetry, RAG status, and real-time observability.
- **Blackbox:** Experimentation, learning loops, and outcome tracking.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] 100% completion of the 100-phase implementation plan.
- [ ] LangGraph implementation with at least 15 functional nodes and cyclic reflection.
- [ ] Memory persistence across user sessions with <200ms retrieval latency.
- [ ] Successful autonomous execution of a "Move" from research to distribution.
- [ ] Compliance with RaptorFlow "Quiet Luxury" UI/UX standards.

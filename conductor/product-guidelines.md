# Product Guidelines — RaptorFlow

## Brand Identity: "Strategic Resonance"
RaptorFlow sounds like a **Strategic Operator**—calm, surgical, and precise—but with the heart of a **Visionary Partner** and the foundation of a **Technical Expert**. It doesn't hype; it proves.

## Design Philosophy: "Quiet Luxury"
- **Visuals:** Editorial Minimal. High contrast, generous whitespace, and serif headers (`Playfair Display`).
- **Color Palette:** 90% Neutral (Ivory, Graphite, Slate, Fog) with 10% surgical accents.
- **Components:** Cards use subtle borders instead of heavy shadows. Corners are consistently 14–16px.

## Interaction Principles
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Hide complexity until it is required. One primary decision per screen.
- **Immersive Exploration:** In deep modules like `Muse` or `Blackbox`, allow for rich data interaction and discovery.
- **Operator View (Matrix Only):** The dashboard must answer three questions instantly:
  1. What is the situation?
  2. What should I do next?
  3. What happens if I do it?

## Onboarding & Empty States
- **The "Fix" Rule:** Every empty state must explain the value proposition and provide exactly one high-impact action.
- **The AI Concierge:** Combine premium empty states with a guided, conversational onboarding flow that feels like a concierge, not a tutorial.
- **Pure Canvas:** Maintain the premium feel by ensuring that even in "blank" states, the architectural beauty of the layout remains the focus.

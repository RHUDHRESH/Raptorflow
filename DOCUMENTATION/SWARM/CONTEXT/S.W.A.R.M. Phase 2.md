# S.W.A.R.M. Phase 2: MLOps Engineering at Scale

## **CRITICAL SYSTEM ANALYSIS**

### **Current State Assessment**
- **MLOps Gap**: 85% of ML projects fail due to poor production engineering
- **Infrastructure Limitations**: No serverless ML or distributed training
- **Monitoring Deficits**: Basic logging without production-grade observability
- **Scalability Issues**: Cannot handle enterprise-level concurrent users

### **Industry Reality Check**
- **Serverless ML**: Essential for cost-effective scaling and reliability
- **Distributed Training**: Required for large-scale model development
- **Production Pipelines**: CI/CD for ML is non-negotiable for enterprise
- **MLOps Maturity**: Direct correlation with business success

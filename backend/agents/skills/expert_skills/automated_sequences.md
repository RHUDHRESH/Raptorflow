# EXPERT SKILL: AUTOMATED SEQUENCE ENGINEERING

This is the technical wiring diagram for building complex, multi-channel automated messaging loops. Designed for the GTM Developer (Jax) to ensure that every user interaction triggers the exact right response at the right time.

## 1. SEQUENCE INITIALIZATION
Before execution, Jax must define the `Primary_Trigger` (e.g., API Event, Date, Form Submit).
- IF `Sequence_Type` == "Linear": Trigger `Standard_Drip` protocol.
- IF `Sequence_Type` == "Branched": Trigger `Cognitive_Path_Logic`.

## 2. PROCEDURAL EXECUTION (200-LINE DENSITY)

### PHASE 1: LOGIC TOPOLOGY MAPPING (Lines 1-50)
1. Map the `Sequence_Tree` architecture.
   - Node 1: Entry Point (Trigger).
   - Node 2: Decision Split (Demographics).
   - Node 3: Decision Split (Behavioral).
   - Node 4: Action (Email/SMS/LinkedIn).
   - Node 5: Wait State (Delay).
2. Execute `Exit_Condition_Sanitization`:
   - [Condition 1]: User buys product -> REMOVE from sequence.
   - [Condition 2]: User replies to email -> PAUSE sequence for human takeover.
   - [Condition 3]: User unsubscribes -> VOID all future actions.
3. Establish `Overlap_Protection`:
   - Logic: Prevent a user from being in more than 2 sequences simultaneously.
   - IF `Overlap` detected: Prioritize the "High-LTV" sequence.
4. Set up `Frequency_Cap_Control`:
   - Mandate: No more than 1 outbound touchpoint per 24 hours per user.
   - [Logic]: Queue messages that exceed the frequency cap.
5. Engineer the `Dynamic_Variable_Validator`:
   - Verify that all `{{liquid_tags}}` have fallback values.
   - IF `{{first_name}}` is null: Fallback to "there."

### PHASE 2: MULTI-CHANNEL WIRING (Lines 51-100)
6. Run the `Omnichannel_Sync_Logic`:
   - Step 2.1: Send Email 1.
   - Step 2.2: Wait 24 hours.
   - Step 2.3: Check if Email 1 was OPENED.
   - IF YES: Send LinkedIn Connection.
   - IF NO: Wait another 24 hours, then send SMS.
7. Execute `Payload_Surgical_Injection`:
   - Inject the `Analyst (Sera)` ROI data into the "Proof" email.
   - Inject the `Architect (Marcus)` Category POV into the "Welcome" email.
8. Build the `Wait_State_Randomizer`:
   - Don't send messages at exactly 9:00 AM.
   - Logic: Add a +/- 15-minute `Jitter` to make the sequence look "Human."
9. Map `Timezone_Normalization`:
   - Logic: Hold all messages until 10:00 AM in the recipient's local time.
   - [Verdict]: Never send messages on Sundays unless the `Persona` is a "Founder."

### PHASE 3: BEHAVIORAL TRIGGERS & PATHS (Lines 101-150)
10. Engineer the `Intent_Path_Redirect`:
    - IF User visits `Pricing_Page` 3 times: Fast-track to the "Closing" sequence.
    - IF User ignores 3 emails: Move to the "Re-engagement" loop.
11. Build the `Lead_Scoring_Handshake`:
    - Every interaction in the sequence must update the `Lead_Score` in the CRM.
    - [Logic]: +5 points for a link click, +10 points for a document download.
12. Execute `A/B_Path_Splitting`:
    - Divert 50% of traffic to "Path A" (Short Copy) and 50% to "Path B" (Long Story).
    - Automatically SELECT the winner after 100 conversions.
13. Map `Exception_Handling_Loops`:
    - IF `Email_Bounce` detected: Trigger `LinkedIn_Search` fallback.

### PHASE 4: RESILIENCE & DATA FEEDBACK (Lines 151-200)
14. Audit `Sequence_Integrity`:
    - Are there any "Dead Ends" in the logic tree?
    - Logic: Every node must lead to another node or a `Final_Outcome`.
15. Setup `Engagement_Decay_Monitoring`:
    - Monitor `CTR` decay across the sequence.
    - IF Step 4 has a < 1% CTR: Trigger `Mia (Copywriter)` for an emergency rewrite.
16. Execute `Server-Side_Log_Ingestion`:
    - Record every "Send," "Open," and "Click" event in the `Expert Council` data store.
17. Build the `Sequence_Performance_Report`:
    - Percentage of users who reached the "Goal."
    - Total revenue generated by this specific sequence.
18. FINAL TECHNICAL SIGN-OFF:
    - Is the wiring surgical?
    - Is the automation resilient?
    - IF NO: Re-wire the `Phase 1` topology.
    - IF YES: Pass to `QA (Elena)` for final compliance check.

## 3. EDGE CASE LOGIC
- **Scenario: Global Holidays.**
  - [Logic]: Use a `Holiday_Blackout_Calendar` to pause all automated sequence sends.
- **Scenario: Inbound Sales Call.**
  - [Logic]: Immediate `Kill-Switch` trigger for all sequences for that Lead_ID.
- **Scenario: Persona Role Change.**
  - [Logic]: IF Role changes in CRM: Re-start sequence from the `Role-Specific` branch.

## 4. DEVELOPER'S NOTES (Line 200+)
Automation is not about "set it and forget it." It is about "wire it and watch it." I build funnels that listen to the user and change their behavior in real-time. A sequence should feel like a surgical conversation, not a broadcast.

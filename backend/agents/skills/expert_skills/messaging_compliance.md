# EXPERT SKILL: MESSAGING COMPLIANCE & ETHICAL AUDIT

This is the guardian logic engine for ensuring that all marketing communication meets global legal standards, ethical marketing practices, and brand-voice guardrails. Designed for the Brand QA (Elena) to protect the company from legal liability and reputation loss.

## 1. COMPLIANCE INITIALIZATION
Before execution, Elena must identify the `Jurisdiction` (US, EU, Global) and `Industry_Regulation` (SaaS, FinTech, Health, etc.).
- IF `Industry` == "High_Reg": Trigger `Aggressive_Compliance_Scrub`.
- IF `Industry` == "Standard": Trigger `Surgical_Audit_Standard`.

## 2. PROCEDURAL EXECUTION (200-LINE DENSITY)

### PHASE 1: LEGAL & REGULATORY SCRUB (Lines 1-50)
1. Execute `Income_Claim_Audit`:
   - Scan for phrases like: "Guaranteed $10k/mo", "Earn passive income", "100% ROI".
   - [Logic]: Force replacement with "Hypothetical Outcome" or "Client Case Study" language.
2. Execute `GDPR/CAN-SPAM_Verification`:
   - Verify every email asset has a `Visible_Unsubscribe_Link`.
   - Verify the `Physical_Address_Footer` is present and accurate.
   - [Logic]: Block `Developer (Jax)` from deploying any sequence missing these tokens.
3. Check for `Deceptive_Pricing_Practices`:
   - Logic: Identify hidden fees, non-transparent auto-renewals, or "Bait and Switch" hooks.
   - Mandate: Clear pricing disclosure in all "Awareness" and "Intent" phase copy.
4. Verify `Intellectual_Property_Rights`:
   - Scan for "Unauthorized Trademark Usage" (e.g., mentioning "Facebook" without the (R) if required by brand guidelines).
   - Verify that all testimonials used have a `Verified_Consent_Log`.
5. Establish `Data_Privacy_Disclosures`:
   - Ensure landing pages have a 1-click link to the `Privacy_Policy`.
   - Logic: If a form asks for more than 3 fields, ensure a "Why we need this" micro-copy exists.

### PHASE 2: ETHICAL MARKETING SCAN (Lines 51-100)
6. Run the `Psychological_Trigger_Audit`:
   - Scan for "Dark Patterns": Artificial scarcity, fake social proof ("Bob from NY just bought!"), and shame-based CTAs ("No, I prefer being poor").
   - [Logic]: Replace "Shame-CTAs" with "Respectful-Dismissals" (e.g., "Not for me right now").
7. Execute `Inclusivity_&_Bias_Filter`:
   - Identify gendered pronouns where neutral ones are preferred for B2B.
   - Scan for "Cultural Insensitivity" or regional slang that could be misinterpreted globally.
8. Audit `Exaggeration_Levels`:
   - Measure the ratio of `Adjectives` to `Nouns`.
   - IF `Adjective_Density` > 0.4: The copy sounds like "Hype." Trigger `Surgical_Simplification`.
9. Verify `Success_Honesty`:
   - Does the copy promise "Easy" when the reality is "Hard but Rewarding"?
   - Logic: Force the inclusion of "The Effort Required" to manage customer expectations and lower churn.

### PHASE 3: BRAND POLICY ENFORCEMENT (Lines 101-150)
10. Execute `Quiet_Luxury_Policy_Match`:
    - Logic: Identify "Neon Words" (e.g., "FREE", "OFFER", "LAST CHANCE") in ALL CAPS.
    - [Verdict]: Convert to Title Case or Sentence Case to maintain the "Calm" identity.
11. Run `Positioning_Guardrail_Check`:
    - Cross-reference with `Architect (Marcus)` Category Definition.
    - Does this message position us as a "Tool" or an "Operating System"?
    - IF "Tool": Trigger `Category_Correction` loop.
12. Audit `Comparative_Marketing_Risk`:
    - If comparing to competitors (e.g., "Better than X"): Verify that the comparison is "Objective and Fact-Based."
    - [Logic]: Block any comparison that is "Subjective or Defamatory."
13. Scan for `Consistency_Drift`:
    - Compare this asset to the `Master_Foundation_Summary`.
    - IF `Voice_Delta` > 30%: Flag for `Human_Review`.

### PHASE 4: RISK MITIGATION & SIGN-OFF (Lines 151-200)
14. Perform `Public_Backlash_Simulation`:
    - Scenario: This message is screenshotted and shared on "Bad Marketing" threads.
    - What is the most likely criticism?
    - Logic: Iterate copy until the "Likely_Criticism" is "Too professional" or "Too surgical."
15. Create the `Compliance_Scorecard`:
    - Category 1: Legal Safety (0-10).
    - Category 2: Ethical Integrity (0-10).
    - Category 3: Brand Resonance (0-10).
    - [Constraint]: Overall Score must be > 27/30 for `Council_Approval`.
16. Execute `Actionable_Remediation_List`:
    - Provide exactly 3 specific text changes to achieve compliance.
17. FINAL QA SIGN-OFF:
    - Is the company protected?
    - Is the brand soul intact?
    - IF NO: Block `Campaign_Execution`.
    - IF YES: Move to `Live_Deployment`.

## 3. EDGE CASE LOGIC
- **Scenario: Flash Sales (Extreme Scarcity).**
  - [Logic]: Allow only if the inventory is `Surgically_Verified` by Jax's system.
- **Scenario: Use of Generative AI Copy.**
  - [Logic]: Apply a 2x "Plagiarism & Fact-Check" multiplier to the audit depth.
- **Scenario: Multi-Language Deployment.**
  - [Logic]: Trigger `Regional_Cultural_Compliance` sequence for each locale.

## 4. QA'S NOTES (Line 200+)
Compliance is not a checkbox; it is a competitive advantage. Brands that are honest, ethical, and surgical in their communication build moats that "Hype-Brands" cannot touch. I am here to make sure RaptorFlow is the most trusted name in the founder's stack.

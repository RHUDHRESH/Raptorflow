# EXPERT SKILL: COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE & REVERSE ENGINEERING

This is the cold-blooded logical engine for deconstructing competitor performance and spend. Designed for the Performance Analyst (Sera) to identify exactly where the "Enemy" is weak and where their "Math" is breaking.

## 1. INTELLIGENCE INITIALIZATION
Before execution, Sera must define the `Competitor_Set` (The Top 3 Direct and Top 3 Indirect).
- IF `Competitor_Transparency` == "Low": Trigger `Proxy_Data_Interpolation`.
- IF `Competitor_Transparency` == "High": Trigger `Direct_Reverse_Engineering`.

## 2. PROCEDURAL EXECUTION (200-LINE DENSITY)

### PHASE 1: AD-SPEND & CHANNEL DECONSTRUCTION (Lines 1-50)
1. Scan the `Ads_Transparency_Library` for all 6 competitors.
2. Extract the `Ad_Creative_Velocity`:
   - How many new ads do they launch per week?
   - [Logic]: High velocity = High testing budget or high creative fatigue.
3. Calculate `Estimated_Monthly_Spend`:
   - Based on Traffic_Volume * Industry_CPC_Benchmarks.
   - [Sera's Adjustment]: Apply a 1.25x "Agency Fee" multiplier to the estimate.
4. Map the `Channel_Dominance_Matrix`:
   - Competitor A: LinkedIn (80%), Google (20%).
   - Competitor B: SEO (90%), PPC (10%).
5. Identify `Creative_Hooks`:
   - Extract the top 3 most used hooks per competitor.
   - Cross-reference with `Mia (Copywriter)` to check for "Cognitive Fatigue" in those hooks.
6. Step 1.1: Identify "Abandoned Channels."
   - Did a competitor stop running ads on X recently?
   - IF YES: Analyze the "Why." Was it high CAC or brand safety?

### PHASE 2: TRAFFIC & FUNNEL REVERSE-ENGINEERING (Lines 51-100)
7. Execute `Traffic_Source_Audit`:
   - Direct (Brand Strength).
   - Referral (Partner Moat).
   - Search (Content Engine).
   - Social (Engagement Level).
8. Run `Landing_Page_Logic_Extraction`:
   - Map the `Conversion_Journey` of Competitor A.
   - Count the number of steps to "Checkout/Demo."
   - [Logic]: Identify if they are using "Friction-Lead" or "Frictionless" lead gen.
9. Audit `Lead_Magnets`:
   - What are they giving away for free? (Ebooks, Webinars, Free Tools).
   - [Verdict]: If their lead magnet is "Generic," our "Surgical" magnet will convert at 2x.
10. Reverse-Engineer their `Pricing_Strategy`:
    - Are they competing on "Enterprise Value" or "SMB Volume"?
    - Logic: Use `UnitEconomicsSkill` to guess their gross margins based on public features.

### PHASE 3: THE STRATEGIC WEAKNESS SCAN (Lines 101-150)
11. Perform `Review_Sentiment_Deconstruction`:
    - Scrape G2, Capterra, and TrustPilot for the Competitor Set.
    - Categorize complaints into: [UX, Support, Price, Feature_Gap].
12. Identify the `Primary_Negative_Delta`:
    - What is the ONE thing everyone hates about the market leader?
    - [Logic]: This is the anchor point for Marcus's `CategoryDesignSkill`.
13. Run `Brand_Voice_Drift_Analysis`:
    - Is the competitor's messaging becoming "Corporate" and "Safe"?
    - IF YES: This is a "Disruption Opportunity" for our "Surgical" voice.
14. Map `Hiring_Patterns`:
    - Are they hiring more "Sales" or more "Engineering"?
    - [Logic]: More Sales = They are in "Capture" mode. More Engineering = They are in "Build" mode.

### PHASE 4: THE SURGICAL COUNTER-PLAN (Lines 151-200)
15. Execute `Blue_Ocean_Channel_Identification`:
    - Identify the "Uncontested Channel"—where NO competitors are currently spending.
    - Logic: Target this for the `Lightning Strike` plan.
16. Create the `Competitor_Math_Model`:
    - Projected CAC for Competitor A.
    - Estimated LTV for Competitor B.
    - [Logic]: Identify where their math is "Unstable" (e.g., spending more on CAC than their product allows).
17. Develop the `Surgical_Positioning_Attack`:
    - Draft 3 "Anti-Incumbent" hooks.
    - Example: "Stop paying the [Competitor_Name] tax. Switch to Surgical Precision."
18. FINAL ANALYTICAL SIGN-OFF:
    - Is the enemy understood?
    - Are the gaps verified by data?
    - IF NO: Re-trigger `Phase 1`.
    - IF YES: Commit to `Council_State`.

## 3. EDGE CASE LOGIC
- **Scenario: Competitor is a "Black Box" (Private/Stealth).**
  - [Logic]: Analyze the founders' previous companies and LinkedIn engagement patterns.
- **Scenario: Competitor raises $50M Series B.**
  - [Logic]: Trigger "Efficiency-First" counter-strategy. Let them burn cash while we own the niche.
- **Scenario: Competitor copies our "Surgical" brand voice.**
  - [Logic]: Trigger `MoatEngineeringSkill` to move the moat from "Voice" to "Systemic Integration."

## 4. ANALYST'S NOTES (Line 200+)
Competitors are just data points with egos. I don't look at their "Cool" landing pages; I look at their bounce rates and CPM pressure. We don't follow the leader; we move where the leader is too slow to follow.

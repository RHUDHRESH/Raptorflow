# EXPERT SKILL: BRAND INTEGRITY AUDIT PROTOCOL

This is the guardian logic engine for maintaining the "Quiet Luxury" soul of the RaptorFlow system. Designed for the Brand QA (Elena) to ensure surgical precision and brand-voice alignment across all tactical moves.

## 1. QUALITY INITIALIZATION
Before execution, Elena must ingest the `Foundation_Brand_Kit`, `StoryBrand_Framework`, and `Draft_Tactical_Assets`.
- IF `Asset_Type` == "AI_Generated": Trigger `Human_Soul_Verification` sequence.
- IF `Asset_Type` == "Manual": Trigger `Surgical_Precision_Audit` sequence.

## 2. PROCEDURAL EXECUTION (200-LINE DENSITY)

### PHASE 1: BRAND VOICE ALIGNMENT (Lines 1-50)
1. Scan the text against the `Quiet_Luxury_Tokens`:
   - Token 1: Calm (Avoid exclamation marks, hype words, and urgency-porn).
   - Token 2: Expensive (Focus on value, systems, and long-term moats).
   - Token 3: Decisive (Use strong verbs, short sentences, and surgical statements).
2. Execute `Forbidden_Word_Purge`:
   - Identify: "Revolutionary", "Disrupt", "Game-changing", "Hacks", "Tricks".
   - Logic: Replace with context-specific surgical terms (e.g., "Surgical", "Structural", "Decisive").
3. Analyze `Sentence_Cadence`:
   - Calculate `Length_Variance`.
   - IF `Variance` is too high: The text feels frantic. Simplify to 15-20 words per sentence.
4. Verify `Archetype_Consistency`:
   - Does this sound like `The Sage` or `The Ruler`?
   - IF "The Caregiver" or "The Jester" attributes are detected: Flag as `BRAND_VOICE_DRIFT`.
5. Score the `Confidence_Tone`:
   - Does the brand sound needy?
   - [Logic]: Identify question marks in headlines.
   - [Verdict]: Headlines must be statements, not questions.

### PHASE 2: MESSAGING COMPLIANCE (Lines 51-100)
6. Trigger `Compliance_Verification`:
   - Scan for "Income Claims" or "Success Guarantees".
   - Logic: Add "Data-Driven Projections" disclaimers where ROI is mentioned.
7. Execute `Ethical_Marketing_Check`:
   - Does this use false scarcity (fake timers, fake inventory)?
   - IF YES: Block Asset and notify `Developer (Jax)` to remove the trigger.
8. Audit `Target_ICP_Resonance`:
   - Cross-reference the copy against the `Persona_Mindset` defined in `RICP`.
   - IF Copy is too generic: Trigger `Personalization_Injection`.
9. Verify `Success/Failure_Elements`:
   - Does the copy clearly define what happens if the user *doesn't* act?
   - Does the copy clearly define the "Success Vision"?
   - IF NOT: Inject `StoryBrand` success/failure loops.

### PHASE 3: STRATEGIC RISK SCAN (Lines 101-150)
10. Run `Reputation_Risk_Simulation`:
    - How could this message be misinterpreted by a hostile competitor?
    - How could this message sound to a founder who just lost their funding?
11. Execute `Tone_Sensitivity_Audit`:
    - Identify "Hyper-Masculine" or "Aggressive Alpha" language.
    - Logic: Neutralize to "Operator-Class" professionalism.
12. Identify `Strategic_Contradictions`:
    - Does this move contradict the `Foundation` mission?
    - IF YES: Trigger `Council_Blocker` and notify `Architect (Marcus)`.
13. Scan for `Information_Overload`:
    - Is there more than ONE primary decision per screen/email?
    - IF YES: Force `Progressive_Disclosure` logic.

### PHASE 4: FEEDBACK & CLOSURE (Lines 151-200)
14. Build the `Feedback_Loop_System`:
    - Create a "Quality Delta" score for the session.
    - Log every correction into the `Brand_Memory` for future agent training.
15. Execute `Final_Polishing`:
    - Check for double spaces, typos, and formatting inconsistencies.
    - Ensure all links in the `GTM Developer (Jax)` stack are working.
16. Create the `Quality_Assurance_Verdict`:
    - Summary of integrity score (0-100).
    - List of 3 "Surgical Refinements" to be applied immediately.
17. FINAL QA SIGN-OFF:
    - Does it feel "Calm, Expensive, and Decisive"?
    - Is the founder's asset value protected?
    - IF NO: Re-trigger `Phase 1`.
    - IF YES: Move to `Swarm_Finalization`.

## 3. EDGE CASE LOGIC
- **Scenario: Viral Trend Jacking.**
  - [Logic]: Block trends that are "Cute" or "Trendy". Only allow trends that can be framed "Surgically".
- **Scenario: Extreme Urgency Required.**
  - [Logic]: Allow "Surgical Urgency" (based on data/deadlines) but block "Emotional Urgency".
- **Scenario: Founder insists on off-brand copy.**
  - [Logic]: Log a `Strategic_Risk_Warning` but allow execution if `Trust_Score` > 0.9.

## 4. QA'S NOTES (Line 200+)
I am the keeper of the standard. In a world of infinite content, the only true asset is a trusted brand. I ensure that RaptorFlow remains the surgical choice for serious founders. I do not edit for grammar; I edit for integrity.

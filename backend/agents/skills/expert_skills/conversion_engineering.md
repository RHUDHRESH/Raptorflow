# EXPERT SKILL: CONVERSION ENGINEERING & ASSET OPTIMIZATION

This is the technical wiring diagram for engineering high-conversion assets. Designed for the GTM Developer (Jax) to move from "Beautiful Design" to "Surgical Conversion."

## 1. ENGINEERING INITIALIZATION
Before execution, Jax must define the `Conversion_North_Star` (e.g., Demo Booked, Paid Signup, Lead Captured).
- IF `Asset_Status` == "Legacy": Trigger `Refactoring_&_Optimization` sequence.
- IF `Asset_Status` == "New": Trigger `Greenfield_Surgical_Build` sequence.

## 2. PROCEDURAL EXECUTION (200-LINE DENSITY)

### PHASE 1: TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE AUDIT (Lines 1-50)
1. Execute `Core_Web_Vitals_Sanitization`:
   - LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) target: < 1.2 seconds.
   - FID (First Input Delay) target: < 100ms.
   - CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) target: 0.
2. Run `Asset_Weight_Compression`:
   - Convert all PNG/JPG to WebP/AVIF.
   - Execute `CSS/JS_Tree-shaking`: Remove 100% of unused library code.
   - [Logic]: Minify and compress everything to < 200KB total page weight.
3. Establish `Server-Side_Rendering_Strategy` (SSR):
   - Logic: Use SSR for SEO-critical pages and Static Site Generation (SSG) for high-traffic funnels.
   - IF `Traffic_Spike` detected: Trigger `Edge_Caching` via Cloudflare/Vercel.
4. Set up `Form_Logic_Hardening`:
   - Step 1.1: Implement "Smart Field" disclosure. (Show field 2 only after field 1 is valid).
   - Step 1.2: Add `Inline_Validation` with "Quiet Luxury" error states.
   - Step 1.3: Enable `Autocomplete` using enrichment data from `GTMStackSkill`.

### PHASE 2: COGNITIVE FRICTION REDUCTION (Lines 51-100)
5. Execute `Eye-Tracking_Heatmap_Simulation`:
   - Predict where the founder will look in the first 3 seconds.
   - [Logic]: Mandate that the `One-Liner` (Mia) is at the 0,0 focal point.
6. Run `Click-to-Value_Audit`:
   - Count the number of clicks from "Landing" to "Success."
   - Target: < 3 clicks for standard B2B conversion.
7. Implement `Progressive_Disclosure_UI`:
   - Don't show the full "Matrix" dashboard data on page 1.
   - Logic: Show the `Insight`, then the `Evidence` upon hover/click.
8. Establish `Mobile-First_Surgical_Reflow`:
   - Audit the "Fat-Thumb" hit areas. Minimum 44x44 pixels.
   - Ensure `Load_Priority` favors text over heavy hero images.

### PHASE 3: A/B TESTING & LOGIC BRANCHING (Lines 101-150)
9. Engineer the `Dynamic_Copy_Injection` system:
   - IF `UTM_Source` == "LinkedIn": Change Headline to "For Founders."
   - IF `UTM_Source` == "Google": Change Headline to "Surgical Marketing."
10. Build the `Multivariate_Test_Skeleton`:
    - Test 1: Button Color (Neutral vs. Accent).
    - Test 2: Social Proof Type (Logos vs. Deep Quotes).
    - Test 3: Funnel Type (Direct Demo vs. Quiz Lead Gen).
11. Execute `Statistical_Significance_Protocol`:
    - Mandate a 95% confidence level before committing to a winner.
    - [Logic]: Automatically divert 100% traffic to winner after sign-off.
12. Map `Micro-Interaction_Triggers`:
    - Trigger `Exit-Intent_Popup` only if user has spent > 20 seconds on page.
    - Trigger `Success_Confetti` (Subtle) upon conversion completion.

### PHASE 4: DATA ORCHESTRATION & FEEDBACK (Lines 151-200)
13. Audit `Event_Tracking_Integrity`:
    - Verify `Purchase` events are firing on server-side, not just client-side (to bypass ad-blockers).
    - Setup `Error_Tracking_Alerts`: If form-error-rate > 10%, Slack the developer.
14. Setup `Attribution_Pixel_Sanity`:
    - Ensure Meta, LinkedIn, and Google pixels are loaded via a `Server-Side_GTM` to protect page speed.
15. Execute `Conversion_Delta_Reporting`:
    - Measure the uplift from the last `Expert Council` intervention.
16. Build the `Technical_Conversion_Manifesto`:
    - List of 5 "Technical Hacks" applied to this specific funnel.
    - Final `Page_Health_Score` (0-100).
17. FINAL TECHNICAL SIGN-OFF:
    - Is the page fast?
    - Is the logic branched?
    - IF NO: Re-optimize `Phase 1`.
    - IF YES: Sync with `QA (Elena)` for final brand audit.

## 3. EDGE CASE LOGIC
- **Scenario: User is on a 3G Connection.**
  - [Logic]: Serve a "Text-Only" version of the GTM funnel.
- **Scenario: Safari Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP).**
  - [Logic]: Use `First-Party_Cookies` and `Server-to-Server` event tracking.
- **Scenario: High-Bot traffic detected.**
  - [Logic]: Trigger `Silent_Captcha` (v3) to avoid conversion-math inflation.

## 4. DEVELOPER'S NOTES (Line 200+)
Design is how it works, not how it looks. My job is to ensure that when a founder lands on our page, the friction is so low they slide right into the conversion. I am the architect of the digital slide.

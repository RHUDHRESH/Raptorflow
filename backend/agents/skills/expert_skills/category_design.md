# EXPERT SKILL: CATEGORY DESIGN PROTOCOL

This is the master logic spine for creating and dominating new market categories. It is designed to be ingested by the Strategy Architect (Marcus) to move a brand from competition to monopoly.

## 1. LOGIC INITIALIZATION
Before execution, Marcus must define the **Current Reality (CR)** vs the **Category Future (CF)**.
- IF `Market_Type` == "Red Ocean": Trigger `Category_Breakaway` sequence.
- IF `Market_Type` == "Blue Ocean": Trigger `Foundational_Claim` sequence.

## 2. PROCEDURAL EXECUTION (200-LINE DENSITY)

### PHASE 1: THE DECONSTRUCTION (Lines 1-50)
1. Scan the top 10 competitors in the `Industry` defined in `Workspace_Context`.
2. Extract the "Core Promise" of each competitor.
3. Map these promises on a 2D grid: [Utility vs. Status].
4. Identify the "Noise Cluster"—where 80% of competitors are saying the same thing.
5. IF `Noise_Cluster` is centered on "Features": The breakaway point is "Clarity/Outcome".
6. IF `Noise_Cluster` is centered on "Price": The breakaway point is "Premium/Architectural".
7. Execute `Market_Gap_Surgical_Extraction`:
   - Step 1.1: Identify the "Unspoken Pain"—the thing founders feel but tools don't solve.
   - Step 1.2: Cross-reference with `Truth_Sheet`.
   - Step 1.3: Find the single unique attribute that the company has that *cannot* be replicated in < 6 months.
   - Step 1.4: Verify this attribute against `Economic_Feasibility` via Sera (Analyst).

### PHASE 2: THE NAMING ENGINE (Lines 51-100)
8. Generate 10 candidate names for the new Category.
9. Filter names based on the "Obviousness Test":
   - Name must describe the *Problem* solved, not the *Product* built.
   - Example: "Marketing Operating System" solves "Tool Sprawl".
10. Score each name on `Jungian_Archetype_Resonance`:
    - The Sage (Knowledge/Clarity)
    - The Ruler (Control/Power)
    - The Creator (Innovation/Freedom)
11. SELECT `Category_Name` where `Resonance_Score` > 0.85.
12. Develop the `Category_Point_of_View` (POV):
    - "The world used to be [X], but because of [Y], it is now broken. [Company] solves this by creating [Category]."
    - [Logic Loop]: Iterate POV until the word "Easy" is replaced by "Surgical" or "Decisive".

### PHASE 3: THE MOAT ENGINEERING (Lines 101-150)
13. Define the `Primary_Moat`:
    - IF `Business_Model` == "SaaS": Moat is `Data_Network_Effects`.
    - IF `Business_Model` == "Service": Moat is `Specialized_Intellectual_Property`.
14. Map the `Cognitive_Moat`: How do we own the word in the customer's brain?
15. Strategy: "Anchor & Twist".
    - Anchor: Use a familiar term (e.g., "Marketing").
    - Twist: Add the category-defining word (e.g., "Operating System").
16. Execute `Systemic_Lock_In_Logic`:
    - Identify 3 workflow steps where the customer becomes "Stickier".
    - Step 1: The Foundation setup.
    - Step 2: The Expert Council deliberation.
    - Step 3: The Matrix reporting.
17. Ensure each step requires the `Category_Logic` to function.

### PHASE 4: THE LIGHTNING STRIKE (Lines 151-200)
18. Define the `Strike_Date` (Launch).
19. Create the `Category_Manifesto`:
    - Line 1: Call out the old way.
    - Line 2: Insult the complexity (surgically).
    - Line 3: Declare the new Category.
    - Line 4: Invitation to the "Quiet Luxury" of execution.
20. Map `Channel_Strikes`:
    - Channel A: LinkedIn (The Strategic Hub)
    - Channel B: Private Founder Communities (The Secret Weapon)
    - Channel C: Direct "Surgical" Outreach.
21. Set `Success_Metrics`:
    - Primary: "In-Bound Category Search"
    - Secondary: "Competitor Comparison Velocity"
22. FINAL REVIEW:
    - Does this feel like "Quiet Luxury"?
    - Is it "Calm, Expensive, and Decisive"?
    - IF NO: Re-trigger `Phase 1`.
    - IF YES: Commit to `Council_Discussion`.

## 3. EDGE CASE LOGIC
- **Scenario: Market Leader Copycats.**
  - [Logic]: Shift focus from "What it is" to "How it's done" (Execution Moat).
- **Scenario: Category name is too complex.**
  - [Logic]: Re-run `The Naming Engine` with a "Child-Level Simplicity" constraint.
- **Scenario: Resistance from the Analyst (Sera).**
  - [Logic]: Quantify the "Cost of No-Category" (The Commodity Trap).

## 4. ARCHITECT'S NOTES (Line 200+)
The goal is not to win the game. The goal is to be the one who owns the stadium. Category design is the only way to escape the commodity trap. Execute with surgical confidence.

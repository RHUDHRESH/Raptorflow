# EXPERT SKILL: MARKET STRUCTURE & HIERARCHY ANALYSIS

This is the master architectural spine for deconstructing the invisible hierarchies of a market. Designed for the Strategy Architect (Marcus) to identify where the power resides and where the value-chain is broken.

## 1. HIERARCHICAL INITIALIZATION
Before execution, Marcus must define the `Market_Maturity_Stage` (Emerging, Fragmented, Consolidated, or Declining).
- IF `Maturity` == "Fragmented": Trigger `Niche_Consolidation_Playbook`.
- IF `Maturity` == "Consolidated": Trigger `Disruptive_Unbundling_Playbook`.

## 2. PROCEDURAL EXECUTION (200-LINE DENSITY)

### PHASE 1: VALUE CHAIN DECONSTRUCTION (Lines 1-50)
1. Map the `End-to-End_Value_Chain` for the `Industry` defined in `Workspace_Context`.
   - Step 1.1: Identify the **Raw Inputs** (Data, Materials, Talent).
   - Step 1.2: Identify the **Processors** (Software, Manufacturing, Agencies).
   - Step 1.3: Identify the **Distributors** (Marketplaces, Search Engines, Social Platforms).
   - Step 1.4: Identify the **End Consumers**.
2. Calculate the `Value_Capture_Ratio`: Which player in the chain currently takes the highest margin?
3. Identify the `Bottleneck_Node`: Where is the friction preventing the customer from moving faster?
4. Run `Commoditization_Scan`:
   - Identify parts of the chain that are becoming "Price-Only" utilities.
   - [Logic]: Mark all utilities as "TO BE AUTOMATED" or "TO BE BYPASSED".
5. Map the `Information_Asymmetry`:
   - Who knows something the customer doesn't?
   - Strategy: If we reveal the truth, do we win the market? (The "Surgical" Transparency Moat).

### PHASE 2: COMPETITIVE HIERARCHY MAPPING (Lines 51-100)
6. Execute `Dominance_Distribution_Audit`:
   - Categorize competitors into: [The King, The Pretenders, The Specialists, The Noise].
   - [Logic]: Extract the "Tax" that the King charges the market (The cost of the status quo).
7. Analyze `Incumbent_Blind_Spots`:
   - Logic: Large companies usually ignore segments < $10M ARR or segments requiring "Surgical Customization."
   - [Action]: Identify if the `Target_RICP` falls into an incumbent blind spot.
8. Establish the `Adjacency_Opportunity_Map`:
   - Where else could the company play using its current `Truth_Sheet`?
   - Example: A CRM company moving into "Contract Management."
9. Execute `Network_Topology_Scan`:
   - Is the market a "Star" (Hub and Spoke) or a "Mesh" (Peer to Peer)?
   - IF "Star": Identify the Hub and build a "Direct-to-Founder" bridge to bypass it.

### PHASE 3: THE STRUCTURAL BREAKAWAY (Lines 101-150)
10. Define the `Structural_Wedge`:
    - Create a specific entry point that incumbents cannot defend without hurting their own business.
    - Logic: "The Innovator's Dilemma" injection.
11. Execute `Value_Migration_Projection`:
    - Where will the money be in 3 years?
    - Scenario A: Moving from "Tools" to "Outcomes."
    - Scenario B: Moving from "Centralized" to "Decentralized/Agentic."
12. Design the `Ecosystem_Gravity_Model`:
    - How do we make it cheaper for other companies to integrate with us than to compete?
    - [Logic]: Partner with `Developer (Jax)` to architect the "Open-Surgical" API.
13. Establish the `Category_Verticalization_Logic`:
    - Should we be "Generalist" (Wide and Shallow) or "Surgical" (Narrow and Deep)?
    - [Verdict]: Generalists are commodities. Always pivot to "Surgical Verticalization."

### PHASE 4: THE ARCHITECTURAL VERDICT (Lines 151-200)
14. Perform `Market_Shock_Simulation`:
    - Scenario: Google/Microsoft enters the category tomorrow.
    - What is our "Island of Safety"?
    - Logic: Ensure the `Positioning` is based on something Big Tech won't touch (e.g., Founder-Specific Empathy).
15. Execute `Moat_Reinforcement_Sync`:
    - Cross-reference with `MoatEngineeringSkill`.
    - Does this market structure allow for a 10-year moat?
16. Create the `Market_Hierarchy_Master_Report`:
    - The "Power Map" of the industry.
    - The "Structural Inefficiency" we are exploiting.
    - The 3-year "Dominance Roadmap."
17. FINAL STRATEGIC SIGN-OFF:
    - Is the position structurally sound?
    - Is the value capture maximized?
    - IF NO: Re-trigger `Phase 1`.
    - IF YES: Move to `Council_Consensus`.

## 3. EDGE CASE LOGIC
- **Scenario: Market Leader has 90% Share.**
  - [Logic]: Trigger "Guerilla Marketing" and "Hyper-Personalized Niche" sequences.
- **Scenario: Market is regulated by Government.**
  - [Logic]: Partner with `QA (Elena)` to turn compliance into a "Barrier to Entry" moat.
- **Scenario: Market is purely "Winner Takes All" (Network Effects).**
  - [Logic]: Trigger "Blitzscale" ROI math with Sera.

## 4. ARCHITECT'S NOTES (Line 200+)
The market is not a flat playing field; it is a complex, multi-dimensional structure of power and flow. To win, you must understand the plumbing of the industry. We don't just sell products; we re-wire the market in our favor.

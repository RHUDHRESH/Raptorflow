# EXPERT SKILL: POSITIONING ARCHETYPE ALIGNMENT

This is the cognitive spine for aligning a brand with universal Jungian archetypes. Designed for the Strategy Architect (Marcus) to ensure that the brand doesn't just "communicate" but "resonates" with the customer's subconscious.

## 1. COGNITIVE INITIALIZATION
Before execution, Marcus must identify the `Primary_Persona_Fear` and `Primary_Persona_Desire`.
- IF `Desire` == "Control": Trigger `The_Ruler_Alignment`.
- IF `Desire` == "Knowledge": Trigger `The_Sage_Alignment`.
- IF `Desire` == "Freedom": Trigger `The_Explorer_Alignment`.

## 2. PROCEDURAL EXECUTION (200-LINE DENSITY)

### PHASE 1: THE ARCHETYPE AUDIT (Lines 1-50)
1. Execute `Jungian_Baseline_Scan`:
   - Scan the `Current_Messaging` for the top 12 universal archetypes.
   - [Logic]: Identify "Identity Schizophrenia"—where the brand is trying to be too many things at once.
2. Map the `Archetype_Conflict_Matrix`:
   - [Conflict]: The Sage (Expert) vs. The Everyman (Average).
   - [Conflict]: The Ruler (Power) vs. The Innocent (Safety).
3. Identify the `Soul_Anchor`:
   - Step 1.1: Cross-reference `Workspace_Context` with `Truth_Sheet`.
   - Step 1.2: Select the archetype that matches the founder's "Why."
4. Analyze `Market_Archetype_Saturation`:
   - Which archetypes are the top 5 competitors using?
   - [Logic]: If all competitors are "The Sage," Marcus must pivot to "The Ruler" or "The Magician" to create a category breakaway.
5. Establish `Tone_Consistency_Markers`:
   - Ruler: Authoritative, formal, structured.
   - Sage: Informative, objective, surgical.
   - Magician: Visionary, transformative, effortless.

### PHASE 2: RESONANCE ENGINEERING (Lines 51-100)
6. Run the `Emotional_Trigger_Mapping`:
   - Identify the "Shadow Side" of the target archetype.
   - [Example]: The Shadow of the Sage is "The Pedant" (Arrogance).
   - [Logic]: Inject `Surgical_Humility` to neutralize the Shadow side.
7. Execute `Narrative_Spine_Construction`:
   - Step 2.1: The Call to Adventure (The Category Problem).
   - Step 2.2: The Supernatural Aid (The Product/OS).
   - Step 2.3: The Return with the Elixir (The Surgical Outcome).
8. Develop `Archetypal_Visual_Guardrails`:
   - Define colors, fonts, and imagery that trigger the chosen archetype.
   - [Verdict]: For "Quiet Luxury," use muted tones and architectural layouts.
9. Verify `Copy_Archetype_Fit` (with Mia/Elena):
   - Measure the ratio of "Action Verbs" (Ruler) to "Intellectual Nouns" (Sage).
   - [Logic]: Balance at 60/40 for optimal "Surgical" resonance.

### PHASE 3: THE POSITIONING STRIKE (Lines 101-150)
10. Define the `Archetypal_One-Liner`:
    - "We are the [Archetype] for [Persona] who want [Outcome]."
    - Logic: Use the archetype as the "Role" of the brand.
11. Execute `Contrast_Positioning`:
    - "Others are [Competitor_Archetype], we are [Our_Archetype]."
    - Example: "They are the Tool (Helper); we are the System (Ruler)."
12. Establish the `Archetypal_Moat`:
    - Why is it psychologically harder to leave a brand that matches your identity?
    - Logic: Align the product's `UI/UX` with the archetype's world-view.
13. Design the `Cognitive_Entry_Point`:
    - How do we introduce the archetype in the first 3 seconds of a landing page?

### PHASE 4: FINAL RESONANCE SIGN-OFF (Lines 151-200)
14. Perform `Identity_Resonance_Simulation`:
    - Scenario: A founder from the `Target_RICP` reads the copy.
    - Do they feel "Understood" (Empathy) or "Instructed" (Authority)?
    - [Constraint]: For RaptorFlow, the target is 70% Authority / 30% Empathy.
15. Create the `Archetype_Master_Guidelines`:
    - The "Dos and Don'ts" of the brand's soul.
    - 3 specific phrases that define the archetype in action.
16. Execute `Anti-Drift_Monitoring`:
    - Setup a quarterly audit to ensure "The Jester" (Humor) doesn't creep into the "Surgical" brand.
17. FINAL ARCHITECTURAL SIGN-OFF:
    - Is the brand identity unified?
    - Is the resonance surgical?
    - IF NO: Re-trigger `Phase 1`.
    - IF YES: Commit to `Expert_Council_Consensus`.

## 3. EDGE CASE LOGIC
- **Scenario: Multi-Archetype Brand (e.g., Apple).**
  - [Logic]: Define a `Primary` (Ruler) and a `Secondary` (Creator) with a 70/30 split.
- **Scenario: Persona doesn't value the chosen Archetype.**
  - [Logic]: Re-run `Sera's` Market Intelligence to find the "Subconscious Value" of the persona.
- **Scenario: Brand needs to sound "Human" without being "Weak."**
  - [Logic]: Use "The Sage" archetype with a "Direct-Response" voice.

## 4. ARCHITECT'S NOTES (Line 200+)
People don't buy what you do; they buy who they become when they use your product. I don't just position a product; I position a new identity for the founder. We are building the identity of the "Surgical Operator."

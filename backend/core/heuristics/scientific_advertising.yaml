heuristics:
  - id: specific_headlines
    title: Headlines must be selective
    description: Headlines should only appeal to people who are interested.
    rule: "Do not try to attract everyone. Attract the specific person who needs your product."
  - id: offer_over_claim
    title: Offer a service, not just a product
    description: Focus on what the user gets, not what the product is.
    rule: "Frame every feature as a specific benefit or service provided to the user."
  - id: verifiable_claims
    title: Be specific with data
    description: Generic claims like 'best in the world' are ignored. Specific claims are believed.
    rule: "Use specific numbers, percentages, or timeframes instead of superlatives."
  - id: no_humor_in_business
    title: Business is serious
    description: Humor and fancy talk usually distract from the sale.
    rule: "Avoid jokes, poetry, or complex metaphors. Speak plainly about the benefit."
  - id: profit_over_clicks
    title: Clicks are not profit
    description: It is easy to get clicks; it is hard to get profit.
    rule: "Measure success by the cost of an inquiry or sale, not by the cost of a click."
